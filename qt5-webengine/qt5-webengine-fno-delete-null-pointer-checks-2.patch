Subject: [PATCH] Use -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks with gcc 6
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

V8 is not safe for removing null pointer checks. Until it is, we need
to disable optimizations in GCC that assume it is not doing something
wrong.

This patch only enables it for v8, and requires it to be activated
by qtwebengine.
