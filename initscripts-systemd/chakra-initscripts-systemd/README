Unit files needed to make systemd a drop-in replacement for the traditional Chakra GNU/Linux initscripts. The obvious goal here is to one day become obsolete.

rc.sysinit
----------
Sequentially:
1) FakeRAID (dmraid)
2) LVM
	TODO: Both dmraid and lvm need testers. The tools do not support hotplugging, so we might need to add some more synchronisation points to avoid races.

rc.shutdown
-----------
chakra-persistent-settings: parses and saves chakra specific settings (i.e. rc.conf) in their respective distro independent places (rather than doing it on boot)
