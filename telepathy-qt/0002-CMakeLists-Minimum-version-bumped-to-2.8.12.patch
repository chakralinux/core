-# CMake policies are used for backwards compatibilty. Setting a policy to a behavior lets newer
-# CMake versions where some behaviors changed behave in a way or another. In our specific case,
-# From CMake's documentation:
-#
-# In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by
-# the include() and find_package() commands would affect the includer.
-# Explicit invocations of cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were
-# required to isolate policy changes and protect the includer.  While
-# some scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer, most do
-# not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and find_package() by
-# default PUSH and POP an entry on the policy stack around an included
-# script, but provide a NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it.  This
-# policy determines whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for
-# compatibility.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply
-# NO_POLICY_SCOPE for include() and find_package() commands.  The NEW
-# behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default
-# cmake_policy PUSH and POP.
-#
-# This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version
-# 2.8.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the
-# cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.
-#
-# Whenever our cmake_minimum_required version bumps up to 2.7 or 2.6.3, this policy setting can
-# hence be removed.
