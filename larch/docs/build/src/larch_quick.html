<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Quick Start - GUI</h2>

<p>The gui should make exploration of the possibilities offered by <em>larch</em>
quite straightforward. The documentation should provide enough information to
understand how a <em>larch live</em> system works, so that further customisations
can be performed beyond those directly supported.
</p>
<p>The general sequence of events starts with creating a 'project', which will
determine certain aspects of the build environment (such as where to place the
installation files), and select a profile. The profile describes the system to be
installed (primarily which packages, but also various other aspects). All this
configuration information is stored in the user's home directory (~/.config/larch),
so that it is retained from one <em>larch</em> run to the next.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>At present I only maintain a repository for 'i686', as I don't run a 64-bit
   <em>Arch</em> machine, but as all the current <em>larch</em> packages
   have architecture 'any', both architectures should be supported.
   </li>
   <li>Make sure you have 'pyqt' and 'python-pexpect' packages, as well as
   the obvious 'python', installed.
   </li>
   <li>Download the latest
   <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/larch/larch8/i686/larch-setup">
   <strong>larch-setup</strong></a> script
   to an empty working directory. Then run it (it is a shell script).
   It will download and prepare the 'larch', 'liblarch' and 'larch-profiles'
   packages so that <em>larch</em> can be run from this directory.
   </li>
   <li>Run './larch' in the working directory.
   As it is a gui program, you must of course be running xorg (see
   <a href="larch_quick-console.html">Command-Line Interface</a>
   for use from the command line). In general you should start <em>larch</em>
   as a normal, unprivileged user, so that the access to the configuration
   files is as the correct user. It will ask for the <em>sudo</em>
   password when it needs it.
   </li>
   <li>To build a <em>larch live</em> system you basically just have to go through
   the tabs one after the other.
   </li>
   <li>The first tab allows you to create a project and select a profile. The 'mini'
   (no <em>xorg</em>) and 'xmini' (a fairly minimal <em>xfce</em> desktop) examples
   (from the supplied 'profiles' folder) might be good places to start.
   The default installation path should be alright for most purposes,
   but you might need to move it if you don't have enough space on that partition.
   Be careful! If you put a silly path in here you might overwrite your system.
   </li>
   <li>The 'Installation' tab performs the installation of the system to be squashed,
   by downloading and installing all the requested packages to the installation path
   set for the project. You can adjust a few aspects of this process, for example
   to use a local package mirror, or to add repositories to pacman.conf. The default
   is to use the mirror set on the host system and also to use the host's package
   cache, so that repeated builds don't need to download the packages all over
   again.
   </li>
   <li>The 'Larchify' tab compresses the installation using squashfs, also building
   a squashed overlay containing all the customisations necessary for the
   <em>live</em> system and those specified in the profile.
   </li>
   <li>Finally the 'Medium' tab writes the prepared <em>larch</em> files to an
   <em>iso</em> file (for CD or DVD), or to the partition of your choice (be careful!),
   so that you end up with a bootable <em>larch</em> system.
   </li>
   <li>Particular things that you might want to customise even in a first test run might
   be the supported <strong>locales</strong> and <strong>rc.conf</strong> (both on the
   'Larchify' tab).
   </li>
   <li>Further details of the customisation process are in the section
   <a href="profiles.html">Profiles</a> and in the documentation to the individual
   gui tabs.
   </li>
   <li>  Share and Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
