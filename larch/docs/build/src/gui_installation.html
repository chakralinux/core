<h2 id="pagetitle" level="2">GUI Tab: Installation</h2>

<p>This tab mixes profile options and project options. Which packages
to install is a feature of the profile, as is the basic design of the
'pacman.conf' file. The exact location of the packages (repository
and cache paths) are more related to the build environment.
</p>

<h3>Package selection</h3>

<p>See <a href="archin.html#package_selection">here</a> for details of how
the list of packages to be installed is built up. The gui offers
convenient editing of the 'addedpacks' and 'vetopacks' files.
</p>

<p><em>pacman</em> configuration is handled in separate parts.
'pacman.conf' is effectively split into two, the options part and the
repositories part can be edited separately, though the default options
should be alright for most purposes. This split might ease management
of updates to the structure of the file 'pacman.conf' with new pacman
releases. Default versions of both parts (for the options part a complete
pacman.conf can be used, the repositories will be stripped automatically)
are supplied in the 'data' directory of the 'larch' package.
A simplified format is used for the repository file, details can be
found <a href="archin.html#pacman_conf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Note that the <em>larch</em> repository must be available for building
the <em>live</em> system, i.e. it must be included in the 'pacman.conf'
used for the installation process. It is not strictly necessary for the
resulting <em>live</em> system to include this repository. See below for
further details.
</p>

<h3>'mirrorlist'</h3>

<p>It is possible to customize the 'mirrorlist' file used for installation.
This can be very convenient, because when building a <em>live</em> system
the build environment can be very different from the run-time environment.
For example, you might use local package repositories for building which
cannot possibly be available when the <em>live</em> system is used.
</p>

<p>Customized versions of the 'mirrorlist' file are not regarded as
belonging to the profile, because they are build environment specific, so
they are stored in the project directory, which is made current when the
larch backend scripts are run.
</p>

<h3>Special installation repositories and cache</h3>

<p>Adjustments to the installation repository file and cache location are
treated as 'advanced' options, because in many cases the defaults will be
perfectly adequate.
</p>

<h4>Using different mirrors/repositories for the installation</h4>

<p>The second part of the 'pacman.conf' file, the repository list, can be
specified separately for the installation, via the frame
'Use project repository list'. For certain build environments this can be
very useful.
</p>

<p>A further way of getting a distinct 'pacman.conf' in the resulting
<em>live</em> system is to put it in the profile's 'rootoverlay' directory
(in the '/etc' subdirectory, as usual).
</p>

<h4>Package cache</h4>

<p>Normally the host's standard package cache will be used for the
installation, but it is possible to use a non-standard location. I guess,
however, that this will not normally be necessary.
</p>

<h3>Tweak installed packages</h3>

<p>To perform small changes to the base installation, such as updating the
packages, or adding or removing the odd package, it may be convenient not
to have to do a complete reinstallation. To this end a set of buttons for
basic pacman operations are included (in an optional frame). Their use
should be fairly self-explanatory. During testing it can
be helpful to be able to make quick changes like this, but it is probably
not a good idea to use these facilities too freely. The installation will
differ from the specification in the profile (unless you immediately edit
the profile too), which may be no problem for one-offs, but if you ever
want to reuse the profile you may well lose track of what changes you have
made.
