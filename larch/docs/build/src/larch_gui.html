<h2 id="pagetitle" level="1">Using the GUI</h2>

<p><em>larch-8</em> can be run from a graphical user interface. This presents
most of the main options in a clear way, avoiding cryptic command-line
mumbo-jumbo.
</p>

<p>The <em>larch</em> documentation is available in the GUI, and there are
documentation pages for each of the tabs in the <em>larch</em> window.
