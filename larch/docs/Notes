Structure of the aufs branches (overlays)
=========================================

larchify creates a squashfs archive (system.sqf) of the base system as
installed by archin. Any changes brought about by the larchification process,
including those specified in the larch profile are saved as a further aufs
branch in mods.sqf.

For writeable media with linux file-systems the medium itself can be used
as the writeable overlay. As the linux filesystem ext4 is used, journalling
may be disabled if desired.

If the boot medium is not writeable (CD/DVD) a writeable overlay is created
in tmpfs (memory). It is also possible to make writeable media act as if
they were read-only by passing 'nw' as a boot parameter. Also in this case
will the writeable layer be created in tmpfs.

Kernel name and mkinitcpio preset name
--------------------------------------
The default kernel (package) name is 'kernel26'. Its mkinitcpio preset name is also 'kernel26',
and the version file is 'kernel26.kver'. The profile 'kernel' file allows
these to be overridden - simply put the new names for kernel binary (default 'vmlinuz26')
and kernel package/preset in there separated by a space character.

In larch-8 there should be no /boot directory in the overlay.
This should also be enforced, so that the only possibility of
getting stuff in there is via cd-root.
